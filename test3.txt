In the once upon a time days of the First Age of
Magic, the prudent sorcerer regarded his own true
name as his most valued possession but also the
greatest threat to his continued good health, for, the
stories go, once an enemy, even a weak unskilled
enemy, learned the sorcerer's true name, then routine
and widely known spells could destroy or enslave
even the most powerful. As times passed, and we
graduated to the Age of Reason and thence to the
first and second industrial revolutions, such notions
were discredited. Now it seems that the Wheel has
turned full circle (even if there never really was a
First Age) and we are back to worrying about true
names again:

The first hint Mr. Slippery had that his own True
Name might be known, and, for that matter, known to
the Great Enemy, came with the appearance of two
black Lincolns humming up the long dirt driveway
that stretched through the dripping pine forest down
to Road 29. Roger Pollack was in his garden weeding,
had been there nearly the whole morning, enjoying
the barely perceptible drizzle and the overcast, and
trying to find the initiative to go inside and do work
that actually makes money. He looked up the moment
the intruders turned, wheels squealing, into his
driveway. Thirty seconds passed, and the cars came
out of the third-generation forest to pull up beside
and behind Pollack's Honda. Four heavy-set men and
a hard-looking female piled out, started purposefully
across his well-tended cabbage patch, crushing tender
young plants with a disregard which told Roger
that this was no social call.
