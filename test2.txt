When practicing writing Hiragana by hand, the important thing to remember is that the stroke
order and direction of the strokes matter. There, I underlined, italicized, bolded, and highlighted
it to boot. Trust me, you'll eventually find out why when you read other people's hasty notes that
are nothing more than chicken scrawls. The only thing that will help you is that everybody writes
in the same order and so the "flow" of the characters is fairly consistent. I strongly recommend
that you pay close attention to stroke order from the beginning starting with Hiragana to avoid
falling into bad habits. While there are many tools online that aim to help you learn Hiragana,
the best way to learn how to write it is the old fashioned way: a piece of paper and pen/pencil.
